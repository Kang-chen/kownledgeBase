# Rule: Changelog

This rule defines the format and maintenance process for the `changelog.md` file, which tracks all significant changes to the knowledge base.

## Log Format

Each entry in the changelog must be in Markdown format and include:
- **Timestamp**: The date and time of the change in `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS` format.
- **Action**: The type of action performed (e.g., `CREATE`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`).
- **Path**: The full path to the file that was changed.
- **Description**: A brief summary of the changes made.

### Example Entry

```markdown
- **2023-10-27 10:00:00** | `CREATE` | `knowledge/biology/new-research-note.md` | Added initial notes on protein folding.
```

## Update Trigger

The `NoteOrganizer` agent (or any other agent making changes) must append a new entry to `knowledge/logs/changelog.md` whenever a file is created, updated, or deleted within the `knowledge/` directory.
