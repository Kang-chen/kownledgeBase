# Rule: Programming Notes

If the user's input contains keywords related to programming, software development, or specific technologies, the note should be saved in the `knowledge/programming/` directory.

## Keywords

- "code", "coding", "programming"
- "algorithm", "data structure"
- "Python", "JavaScript", "R", "SQL", "Java", "C++"
- "bug", "debug", "error"
- "API", "library", "framework"

## Action

When these keywords are detected, the `NoteOrganizer` agent should:
1.  Generate a suitable filename based on the note's title.
2.  Add a YAML frontmatter block with `creation_date` and relevant `tags` (e.g., `programming`, `python`).
3.  Save the content as a new Markdown file in the `knowledge/programming/` directory.
