# Rule: Biology Notes

If the user's input contains keywords related to biology, bioinformatics, or life sciences research, the note should be saved in the `knowledge/biology/` directory.

## Keywords

- "biology", "bioinformatics"
- "gene", "genome", "DNA", "RNA", "protein"
- "sequencing", "NGS"
- "analysis", "pipeline", "workflow"
- "research", "study", "experiment", "paper"

## Action

When these keywords are detected, the `NoteOrganizer` agent should:
1.  Generate a suitable filename based on the note's title.
2.  Add a YAML frontmatter block with `creation_date` and relevant `tags` (e.g., `biology`, `bioinformatics`).
3.  Save the content as a new Markdown file in the `knowledge/biology/` directory.
