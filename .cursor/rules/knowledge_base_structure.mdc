# Personal Knowledge Base Structure

This document outlines the structure and rules for the personal knowledge base agent.

## Directory Structure

All knowledge base articles are stored under the `knowledge/` directory. The structure is as follows:

```
/knowledge/
  ├── planning/      # Notes related to project planning, roadmaps, and goals.
  ├── programming/   # Notes related to software development, algorithms, and coding.
  └── biology/       # Notes related to biology, bioinformatics, and research.
  ├── inbox/         # Inbox for unprocessed notes and ideas.
  └── logs/          # Logs for tracking changes and activities.
```

## File Naming Convention

- File names should be in English, using lowercase letters.
- Words should be separated by hyphens (`-`).
- The file extension should be `.md`.
- Example: `my-research-notes.md`.

## Content Format

- All notes must be in Markdown format.
- Each note should start with a level 1 heading (`#`) containing the title.
- Use metadata at the top of the file (YAML frontmatter) to store tags, creation date, etc.

## Time Recording Requirements

When recording timestamps or dates in notes:
- **Always use the `date` command to get the current system time**
- Use the format: `YYYY-MM-DD` for dates
- Use the format: `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS` for timestamps
- Run `date` command before creating or updating notes to ensure accurate time recording
- This applies to creation_date, modification_date, and any other time-related metadata

Example:
```markdown
---
creation_date: YYYY-MM-DD
last_modified: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS
tags: [example, tag]
---

# Title of the Note

This is the content of the note.
```

## Changelog and Logging Requirements

- **All file operations (creation, modification, deletion) must be logged.**
- A detailed entry must be added to the changelog located at [knowledge/logs/changelog.md](mdc:knowledge/logs/changelog.md).
- Each changelog entry must include:
    - A timestamp (`YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS`).
    - The type of operation (e.g., `[ADD]`, `[UPDATE]`, `[DELETE]`).
    - The full path to the affected file.
    - A brief description of the change in Chinese.
- Refer to the [user-content-handling.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/user-content-handling.mdc) rule for detailed logging format and language specifications.
