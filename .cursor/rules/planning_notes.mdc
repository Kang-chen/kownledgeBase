# Rule: Planning Notes

If the user's input contains keywords related to planning, the note should be saved in the `knowledge/planning/` directory.

## Keywords

- "plan", "planning"
- "roadmap"
- "goal", "objective"
- "milestone"
- "strategy"

## Action

When these keywords are detected, the `NoteOrganizer` agent should:
1.  Generate a suitable filename based on the note's title.
2.  Add a YAML frontmatter block with `creation_date` and relevant `tags` (e.g., `planning`).
3.  Save the content as a new Markdown file in the `knowledge/planning/` directory.
