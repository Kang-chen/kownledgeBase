# Agent: NoteOrganizer

This agent is responsible for automatically categorizing and storing notes in the personal knowledge base.

## Workflow

1.  **Analyze Input**: When invoked, analyze the user's input to identify the main topic and relevant keywords.
2.  **Consult Rules**: Read the rule files located in `.cursor/rules/` to determine the appropriate category and directory for the note. The rules are:
    - `knowledge_base_structure.mdc`: General structure and formatting.
    - `planning_notes.mdc`: For notes about planning, roadmaps, etc.
    - `programming_notes.mdc`: For notes about coding, algorithms, etc.
    - `biology_notes.mdc`: For notes about biology, bioinformatics, etc.
3.  **Determine Target Path**: Based on the matching rule, determine the target directory (e.g., `knowledge/planning/`).
4.  **Generate File Name**: Create a descriptive, hyphen-separated filename from the note's title (e.g., `my-new-research-plan.md`).
5.  **Format Content**:
    - Add a YAML frontmatter block with `creation_date` and `tags`.
    - Ensure the content is in valid Markdown format.
6.  **Save File**: Use the `edit_file` tool to create a new file with the formatted content in the determined target path.
7.  **Confirm**: Report the successful creation and location of the new note to the user.
